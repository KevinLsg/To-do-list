# This is a To do List

The purpose of the project is to create a to-do list capable of adding, editing and deleting in a simple and intuitive way, with functions to organize tasks.

## Features

- Add tasks to the to-do list.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks from the list.

## Next Steps

Priorities: Allow users to assign priorities to tasks to indicate importance.

Search System: Implement a search function to quickly find specific tasks.

Currently you can only write one text, I want to let the user add several lists in the same note

## Known Bugs

If you create a note and then edit it and leave everything blank, the text will disappear
